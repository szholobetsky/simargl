"""exporter — dump TASKS/COMMITS rows from a simargl ingest SQLite db to flat
text files, one file per unit, for `/flow glossary index <out_dir>` to consume.

glossary.py (1bcoder/vyrii) stays schema-agnostic by design (see
concepts/GLOSSARY.md — self-contained, portable /flow files) — it only ever
reads folders of text files. This module is where TASKS/COMMITS schema
knowledge lives, reusing the same tables and query patterns as index_units()
in indexer.py, so the schema is understood in exactly one place.

Tasks and commits are exported into two separate subfolders (out_dir/tasks,
out_dir/commits), not merged into one document per task — a docs-glossary,
a tasks-glossary, and a diffs-glossary carry knowledge at different levels
and are meant to be /flow glossary index'd as separate --project namespaces,
then cross-referenced later via their [file: ...] source tags, not
pre-combined.
